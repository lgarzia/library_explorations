b'Write a function that takes two lists and returns a list that has alternating elements from each input list.'
b'Can you write some test cases for this function?'
b'Modify the function so that it returns all input elements when the lists have uneven length. The elements from the longer list should be at the end.'
b'My code below is not working. Can you see what may be wrong?```def factorial(n):   r = 0   for i in range(n):       r *= i   return r```'
b'Can you use this function to create a code to compute the number of k-combinations of a set of n elements?'
b'Thanks.'
b'I have a CSV file that looks like this:NameSalaryBob12000Avantika35000Alice30000Write a program that returns the name of the person with the highest salary.'
b'What is the purpose of the code below ?```def f(n p):   if p == 0:\\treturn 1   else :   \\treturn n*f(n p-1)```'
b'Write a program that returns the prime numbers less than 1000 that are congruent to 1 modulo 6.'
b'Can you translate the code below in Java? ```print(\xe2\x80\x9cHello world\xe2\x80\x9d)```'
b'I want to load a struct with 3 values into a struct with only 2 values. ```typedef struct {    double x    double y} twodtypedef struct {    double x    double y    double z} threed```The second struct contains arrays of coordinates for the 3d plane. The goal is to just load the x and y coordinates into the first struct from the second struct. Is that possible considering they are different typedefs? How would a solution be implemented?'
b'I&amp#x27ve installed Django multiple ways via apt-get and pip install. They all say I have the most recent version of Django. Now whenever I run python in Terminal and type in import django I receive ```ImportError: No module named django```However when I run django-admin --version I receive```1.4.3```I know it&amp#x27s installed but why is python not finding the django module?'
b'The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?'
b'Nice. Can you write a python function to solve this problem? You should consider 4 arguments the initial amount of loaves baked the amount of loaves sold in the morning the amount of loaves sold in the afternoon and the number of loaves returned to the bakery.'
b'Can you test your function with the following inputs?24 5 9 3153 57 99 32'
b'Would you rather have a pizza or a burger for lunch?'
b'I think it is fine if you go beyond what you are designed for.'
b'Can you write a python function to randomly decide between eating a pizza or a burger with probability 0.3 and 0.7 respectively?'
b' I have a dictionary with lots of dictionaries inside it and so on how can I make that into just one single dictionary?'
b' Yeah these are dictionaries with keys and values and the values themselves are dictionaries.'
b' Yeah.  Hmm I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure maybe underscore'
